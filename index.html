                    <p>Unite De Lutte Pour La Sante (ULS) is a non-profit faith-based community development organization helping the people of our communities be healthy, self-sufficient citizens. 
                        Our organization was founded in 2010 with Haitian doctors, nurses and other community supporters and is registered with the Haitian Ministry 
                        of Health. Our primary health care center was established at Bande du Nord / communal section in Cap-Haitian, Haiti in December 2010, and in 
                        December 2011 we developed an affiliated community clinic in Mombin-Crochu village focused on providing medicine to prevent death and stroke 
                        due to high blood pressure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we understand that good health is more than just good medicine and as a result have developed programs and services that support good nutrition; 
                        economic well-being and education. Our goal is on empowering the very poor by developing a partnership with them where they learn how to care for themselves, 
                        their families and communities, and obtain a self-sufficient quality of life.
