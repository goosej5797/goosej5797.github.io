                    <h1>About ULS</h1>
                    <p>In 2010 a mobile health clinic introduced the resident’s of Bande du Nord and Fort-Bourgeois to health services 
                        previously not available due to the distance of these communities to the nearest health center in Northern Haiti. 
                        Since then working with volunteer nurses, doctors, and community people, Dr. Maudelin Mesadieu’s has established 
                        permanent health centers at Fort Bourgeois community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The clinics are run by 19 staff: three doctors, five nurses, one laboratory technician, six community health worker, 
                        one manager, and office attendant and TBAs and others volunteer.  ULS provides general consultation, medicines, simple 
                        lab tests, immunization, ready-to-use therapeutic foods for the treatment and prevention of childhood malnutrition, and 
                        family planning and services. Each clinic services an estimated 800 clients per month. Most of its supplies and medicines 
                        are donated by the Ministry of Health and donor agencies. ULS offers free services whatever patients can pay. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ULS works in partnership with a community advisory board work  that helps ULS staff understand the needs of the people 
                        as well as  identifying TBAS, mothers for the mothers clubs and the location for the mobile clinic.
